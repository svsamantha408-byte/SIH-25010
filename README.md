## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution

<img scr="c:\Users\acer\Downloads\agri.png" height="500" width="800">

<ul><li>Crop planning system.</li>
<li>Push notification.</li>
<li>Market access for selling and purchasing.</li>
<li>Offline capabilities.</li>
<li>Weather forcasting </li>
<li>AI based app with chatbot.</li>
<li>A multilingual app.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>HOW IT ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM</h3>
<ul>
<li>Crop planning system - Most of the farmers does't have more knowledge about timely farming .so crop planning can help the farmers about what to plant in a particular season.</li>
<li>Push notification- To provide the notification about the upcoming tasks, available govt schemes , weather forcasts,etc,.</li>
<li>Market access foe selling and purchasing - To provide knowledge about the market condition about available seeds,fertilisers,pesticides,etc, to purchase. To provide information about the real time market price for selling the goods. </li>
<li>Offline capabilities - To use the app in deep area where there is no enough network facilities.</li>
<li>Weather forcasting - To provide timely awarness about the weather condition .</li>
<li> Ai based app with chatbot- Abilites to the farmers to use the app efficiently for getting fast response about thier doubts.</li>
<li>Multilingual app - to make the farmers to access the app actively from their own language.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Innovation and uniqueness of the solution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Combines AI + IoT + localized language support.</li>

<li>Focuses on ease of use for low-literate farmers through voice-based interaction.</li>

<li>Integrates image-based diagnosis for pests and diseases.</li>

<li>Uses predictive analytics for weather-based alerts.</li>

<li>Integrates market data and soil health metrics for holistic advisory</li>

<li> Designed for offline-first usage in low-connectivity areas</li>
</ul>


<h2> Technologies to be used:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Programming Languages & Frameworks: Python (AI/ML models), Django/Flask (backend), React Native/Flutter (mobile app).</li>

<li>AI/ML: TensorFlow/PyTorch for pest detection & crop recommendation models.</li>

<li>APIs: Weather APIs, government soil databases, market price APIs.</li>

<li>Databases: PostgreSQL/MySQL with spatial data support.</li>

<li>IoT/Hardware (Optional Extension): Soil health sensors for live data collection.</li>

<li>Frontend: Flutter (multilingual UI, voice support)</li>

<li>Backend: Node.js/Django (API orchestration, user management)</li>
</ul>
<h2 textcolor="red">Methodology and process of implementation: </h2>
<ul>
<li> Analysis the needs–Identify farmer needs, target regions, and languages.</li>

Data Collection – Gather information about soil, weather, pest, and crop .</li>

 Developmented models – Train AI/ML models for crop recommendation & pest detection.</li>

App Development – Build a cross-platform mobile application with chatbot .</li>

Integration – Link APIs for weather, soil, and market price updates.</li>

Examining – Pilot testing with farmers in required regions.</li>

Deployment & Feedback Loop – Continuous improvement based feedbacks from the farmers  .</li>

</ul>
<br>
<h2 textcolor="red">Feasibility :</h2>
<ul>

<li>Uses proven tech stacks and open datasets .</li>
<li> Modular architecture for easy scaling and updates .</li>
<li> Can be piloted in one district and scaled nationwide .</li>
</ul>
<h2 textcolor="red">Challenges:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Connectivity: Offline-first design with periodic sync.</li>
 <li>Language: NLP models trained on regional dialects.</li>
 <li>Adoption: Partner with NGOs and extension officers for onboarding.</li>
 </ul>
 

<h2 textcolor="red"> Impact and Benefits</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Empowers farmers with scientific decision-making.</li>
 <li>Reduces input costs, increases yield and income.</li>
 <li>Promotes sustainable farming and reduces chemical overuse.</li>
 </ul>
